## ERD

- A customer can place several orders. Therefore, between Customer and Order there must be a one-to-many relationship.
- An order can contain one or several items, each of which represents a single product. Order_Item is a dependent entity of Order, since it has no reason to exist if an order does not exist. In addition, Order_Item is related to Product through a one-to-many relationship: each Order_Item is related to one Product, and a Product can be related to multiple Order_item
- An order is associated with one payment and one shipment, but each payment and each shipment can include multiple orders. For this reason, there are one-to-many relationships between Payment and Order and between Shipment and Order.
- A product can belong to a single category: there is a one-to-many relationship between Product and Category.
- The shopping cart and the wish list are dependent entities of Customer, so both Cart and Wishlist maintain a dependency relationship with Customer. In turn, each instance of Cart and of Wishlist is related to a product, so both entities have many-to-one relationships with Product.
## Support
-An order is associated with one payment and one shipment, but each payment and each shipment can include multiple orders. For this reason, there are one-to-many relationships between Payment and Order and between Shipment and Order.
